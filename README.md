Abstract:
Cambrian Analytica is a speculative design project that aims to answer the question:
“What would it take for people to care about their personal data?”
By using real personal data to generate zoomorphic incarnations of daily behavior, the project seeks to bring attention to the opportunities for self-reflection in a digital age.
